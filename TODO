general:
- implement wth_display protocol
- Write documentation and use Doxygen to format it
- code clean-up: style unification, dead code removal
- drop dependency to libwayland
- drop dependency to glib
- wthp_registry implementation?
- the fate of wth_display, hide it completely in wth_connection and rename?
- implement object id re-use
- implement server-side object allocation
- implement protocol version negotiation
- add listening socket API (usefulness?)
- error delivery: see the comments in object_post_error() in
  tests/server-api-example.c
- fix build with -DDEBUGGING
- remove hdr_t.api field

generator:
- data type: autogenerate the foo_sz arg
- rewrite the generator to become more readable and maintainable

serialiser:
- implement send-buffering (non-blocking sending)
- support custom protocol extensions

deserialiser:
- support custom protocol extensions

tests/examples:
- fix server read error when client disconnects
- make the examples use more protocol and document better
- write a test suite

build:
- check for timerfd in configure
- build just one libwaltham, no need for separate server and client libs
