Waltham
=======

Waltham is a network IPC library designed to resemble Wayland both
protocol and protocol-API wise.

Waltham does not (yet) support any kind of encryption, so usage in
untrusted networks is not advised.

Protocol is described in XML files. The generator translates XML into C
code.


Building and testing
====================

Waltham depends on glib and wayland, but these dependencies are to be
removed.

To build:
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make

To test, first start the server:
$ ./tests/sapiex

Then in another terminal, run the client:
$ ./tests/capiex

The client does a wth_display.sync, waits for the answer, and exits.

The server can be stopped with ctrl+c.

The client can be run repeatedly, but currently running several clients
at the same time is not supported. See TODO for more unfinished items.
